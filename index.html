                    <p>Aren't I cute?  I'm a West Highland white terrier living my best life with my forever family in the Greater St. Louis area.  Life wasn't always this great though...</p>

                    <p>I can't quite remember how many other animals lived with me, but I will tell you that at least nine of them were cats. I'm allergic to cats and unable to control myself around their food.  As my former family added more and more cats to our home, I lost my fur, gained way too much weight, and broke out in a rash that escalated to a skin infection.  Finally, a relative took me from my former family, and placed me in the care of Partners for Pets.</p>
                    <p>Living in an animal shelter was a welcome change.  I had plenty of new, and I wasn’t allergic to any of them!  With medical treatment the absence of feline roommates, my skin healed, and my fur started to grow back.  I was only at the shelter for a few weeks before I was introduced to the people who would become my forever family. </p>

                    <p>I finally got to meet my new family at a random Petco.  Everything was official after I successfully got along with my sister, Roxie.  By the way, she was not interested in meeting me at all, but I loved her instantly!  The rest of the family decided that we would get to know each other better over time.  This is definitely true, but she still does not enjoy playing with me.</p>

                <img src="html-me-something-imgs/Maggie (18).jpg" alt="Maggie" height="300" width="auto">
                    <p>Getting used to my new family was not as easy as I thought it would be. All the smells where new, and it took me a while to find my favorite spots to relax.  I love to lay in the sun, and it took me FOREVER to find the best spots to do that.  My sister was exceptionally territorial, and the sibling rivalry was (and still is) very real!</p>

                    <p>Speaking of my sister, here she is… stealing my moment.  I have to be honest with you… The sibling rivalry is still very real.  Roxie plays with me sometimes, but she still tries to steal my bed, and if anyone is playing with me or giving me any attention whatsoever, she has to interrupt them…</p>

                    <p>These days, I'm living the dream.  We go to the park all the time, I have tiny humans to play with, it's really great!  Although sometimes, they do dress me in weird costumes... who cares though as long as we get to go somewhere!</p>
